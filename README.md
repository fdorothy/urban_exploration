# Urban Exploration

Urban exploration text adventure game.

## Dependencies

The code is a simple html, js and a set of media files. You will need to be able to run a local web server to host those files. I use static-server which is available through the node package manager (npm). There are a million other ways to locally host the content.

## Installation

Open a terminal and run the following commands to checkout and run the game locally:

```
git clone git@github.com:fdorothy/urban_exploration
cd urban_exploration
npm install -g static-server
static-server .
```

Visit localhost:9080 in your web browser. The game should load and be playable!
